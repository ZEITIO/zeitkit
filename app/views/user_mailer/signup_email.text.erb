I'm Hendrik, one of the founders of Zeitkit. I wanted to reach out to see if you need any help getting started. Also curious if there are features that are missing to better support your workflows.

Lastly wanted to let you know - Zeitkit is open source. You can have a look at the source code/submit enhancements. You can find the repository here at Github: https://github.com/ZEITIO/zeitkit. A star would be superb.

Thanks,
-Hendrik
