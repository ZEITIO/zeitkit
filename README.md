# Zeitkit

The goal of Zeitkit has been to develop a super simple time tracking software that is highly adjusted to the needs of developers.

* Track time for your clients
* Write detailed descriptions of what you have done
* Organize clients
* Write monthly invoices based on your worked times
* Manage a whole team with shared clients
* Reporting to see how your team is doing
* Fully fledged PDF invoice generation. 100% compilant with German law.
* View the demo: [http://zeitkit.com](http://zeitkit.com)
